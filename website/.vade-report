# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1)
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with dependency resolution

### 2. Analytics Integration
Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `</SidebarProvider>` closing tag
- Preserved all existing code structure and functionality

## Implementation Details
The Analytics component was placed strategically:
- Inside the `<body>` tag (required for proper tracking)
- After the main content providers and components
- Before the closing `</body>` tag

This ensures that:
1. Analytics tracks all pages in the application
2. The component loads properly without interfering with existing functionality
3. The placement follows Vercel's best practices for App Router projects

## Verification
- ✅ Package successfully installed via npm
- ✅ Code compiles successfully (Analytics component integrated properly)
- ✅ Linting passed with no errors introduced
- ✅ Existing code structure and functionality preserved

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

## Notes
- The build encountered an unrelated error about missing OPENAI_API_KEY for the chat API route, which is a pre-existing issue not related to the Analytics implementation
- The Analytics component itself compiled successfully without any issues
- The implementation follows Next.js App Router conventions and Vercel's recommended setup
